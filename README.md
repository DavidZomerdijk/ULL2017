# EM based clustering for learning verb and noun classes

An implementation of the paper: [*"Inducing a Semantically Annotated Lexicon via EM-Based Clustering"* by Mats **Rooth**, Stefan Riezler, Detlef Prescher, Glenn Carroll  and Franz Beil (May **1999**)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9905008).

This was the original paper introducing **latent semantic clustering**, an unsupervised method to find good clusters of words from a dependency parsed corpus.

We wrote a report on this implementation as well, which can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bmcfwrvyqnkq).

Our implementation is divided up into two steps:

- 1: Verb classes (corresponding to Section 2 in the paper), with Evaluation from (Section 3)
- 2: Subject/Object classes (corresponding to Section 4 in the paper)

This implementation was done as an assignment for the Unsupervised Language Learning course at the University of Amsterdam in 2017 by [David Zomerdijk](https://github.com/DavidZomerdijk/), [Maurits Bleeker](https://github.com/MBleeker) and [Thijs Scheepers](http://github.com/tscheepers).
